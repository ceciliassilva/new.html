  <h2> by.Gawon Park 02/27/2024 02:40 ET </h2>
    <p>
      BTS member Jungkook has made it to the top 10 of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry <abbr>(IFPI)</abbr> '2023 Global Single Chart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the IFPI official website on the 26th (local time), Jungkook's solo single 'Seven' <strong> ranked10th on last year's</strong> Global Single Chart.
    </p>
<p>
  <em> While Miley Cyrus's 'Flowers'</em> took the top spot, <em>SZA's 'Kill Bill'</em> secured 3rd place, and <em>Harry Style's 'As It Was'</em> ranked 5th. Among them, Jungkook was the <strong>only korean singer</strong> to make it to the top 10.
</p>
<p>IFPI, which has over 8,000 record companies worldwide as its members, calculates the rankings of the Global Single Chart by aggregating figures such as paid subscription streaming and single track downloads.
</p>    
    <p>In 2012, singer PSY entered this chart as the first Korean singer with 'Gangnam Style,' and in 2020 and 2021, BTS made their mark with 'Dynamite' and 'Butter,' respectively.
</p>
    <p>BTS's agency, Big Hit Music, explained, <q>Jungkook is the first Korean solo artist to enter this chart in 11 years since PSY, and the first Korean artist to make his name known through both group and solo activities.</q>
</p>
    <p>
      'Seven' soared to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 main single chart immediately after its release in July last year and gained worldwide popularity by also ranking 3rd on the UK Official Singles Chart.
